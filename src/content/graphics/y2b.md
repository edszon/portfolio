desc: Yeezus II was initially conceived as a way to release a significant portion of the material that was left out of the production of Yeezus, a process heavily influenced by producer Rick Rubin's streamlined approach. During the development period of Yeezus II, Ye began a significant collaboration with the legendary Paul McCartney, former "The Beatles". He would also conduct studio sessions in Mexico.
